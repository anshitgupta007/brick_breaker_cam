# Brick Breaker Game with Hand Recognition Control

## Overview

This is a brick breaker game implemented in Python, where the player controls the bat using hand gestures recognized through a webcam. The project leverages the `cvzone` library for efficient hand tracking and detection with the help of `cv2` (OpenCV). The game provides an interactive experience, allowing players to break bricks by moving their hand, all powered by computer vision technology.

## Features

- **Hand Recognition Control:** The bat's movement is controlled by recognizing hand gestures captured through the webcam using `cvzone`.
- **Classic Brick Breaker Gameplay:** Break the bricks using the ball without letting it fall off the screen.
- **Scoring System:** Keep track of your score as you break more bricks.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.8
- cvzone (install using `pip install cvzone`)
- OpenCV (install using `pip install opencv-python`)
- Random (usually included in the standard Python library)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/anshitgupta007/brick_breaker_cam.git

2. Install dependencies:

4. Have fun playing the game!

## Controls
  Hand Gesture Control: Move your hand left or right to control the bat's horizontal movement.
